OVERVIEW

HTTPS mode is an experimental feature in moOde that enables secure communication
between the Browser and moOde/NGINX web server. This is achieved through use of
a self-signed Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate.

This certificate is automatically created and installed into NGINX when HTTPS
mode is turned on. A manual procedure is then required to import the certificate
into the Browser/OS certificate trust store. Once this is done The Browser will
be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde/NGINX.

BASIC PROCEDURE (Desktop OS)

Below is a basic procedure for managing HTTPS mode, configuring Browser
settings and importing the certificate. The detailed steps vary depending on
Browser and Operating System (OS).

1. Open http://moode
2. Turn HTTPS mode ON (in System Config)
3. Reboot

4. Open http://moode or https://moode
5. Browser security warnings will appear and access to moOde will be blocked
6. Click the appropriate button to View the security certificate
7. Click the appropriate button to Export the certificate (specify DER encoding)

8. Open the OS Certificate Trust Store
9. Import the certificate that was exported in the prior step into the System,
   or other appropriate section of the Trust Store
A. View the certificate in the Trust Store and set its Trust policy to "Always"

B. Refresh the Browser and a secure HTTPS connection should be established with
   no Browser warnings

Turn HTTPS mode OFF
