OVERVIEW

HTTPS mode is an experimental feature in moOde that enables secure communication
between the Browser and moOde/NGINX web server. This is achieved through use of
a self-signed or CA-signed Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate (cert).

SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE

This type of cert is automatically created and installed into NGINX when HTTPS
mode is turned on. The cert can be downloaded via the DOWNLOAD button or Browser
Export option and then a manual procedure is required to import the cert into
the Operating System (OS) Certificate Trust Store. After this is done the
Browser will be able to establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde/NGINX.

CA-SIGNED CERTIFICATE

This type of cert is created by a Certificate Authority (CA) and installed into
NGINX via the UPLOAD button. A manual procedure is used to import the cert into
the OS Certificate Trust Store. After this is done the Browser will be able to
establish secure HTTPS communication with moOde/NGINX.

BASIC PROCEDURE (Desktop OS)

Below is a basic procedure for configuring HTTPS mode. The detailed steps for
importing the cert into the OS Certificate Trust Store vary depending on OS.

1. HTTPS mode on

a. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
b. Set the Certificate type to "Self-signed"
c. Turn HTTPS mode ON
d. DOWNLOAD the cert
e. Install the downloaded cert into the Desktop OS Certificate Trust Store and
   set its Trust policy to "Always trust"
f. Reboot moOde
g. Refresh the Browser and a secure HTTPS connection should be established with
   no Browser warnings

2. HTTPS mode off

a. Open System Config and scroll to the Security section
b. Turn HTTPS mode OFF
c. Reboot
d. Open http://moode
e. A non-secure HTTP connection should be established

3. Changing the host name

If the host name is changed via System Config while HTTPS mode is ON and a
self-signed cert is being used a new self-signed cert will be automatically
generated and installed into NGINX during startup after reboot.

Refresh the Browser and follow the steps below.

a. Click the browser "Security warning" badge to view the cert
b. Navigate to an option that offers an "Export" button
c. Click the Export button
d. Select DER encoding format
e. Download the cert
f. Install the downloaded cert into the Desktop OS Certificate Trust Store and
   set its Trust policy to "Always trust"
