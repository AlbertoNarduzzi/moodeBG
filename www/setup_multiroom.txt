PREFACE

This release of moOde Multiroom audio is designed for listening in a casual
or background setting. There is no support in this release for audiophile
features including uncompressed PCM format, rates greater than 48K, DSP or
clock correction between Sender and Receiver. These features may however appear
in future releases.

OVERVIEW

A moOde multiroom audio system consists of a Sender and Receivers. The Sender
should be a dedicated moOde player configured to output to the integrated HDMI
port or optionally the Headphone jack but not connected to any speakers or
headphones. It functions solely to send what it is currently playing to one or
more Receivers. NOTE: There can only be one Sender on the network.

RECEIVER CONFIGURATION

Receivers should be configured first. The Receiver player daemon is separate
from MPD and the Audio Renderers and thus the Receiver configuration should be
dedicated although it's not absolutely required. A Receiver can have AirPlay and
Spotify renderers running in the background but there is no coordination between
them and the Receiver player. Initiating a Spotify or AirPlay connection while
the Receiver player is ON will result in audio output conflicts and errors.

A) Audio Configuration (Menu, Configure, Audio)

1. In the Audio Output section
   - Configure settings appropriate for the audio device being used
   - To control Receiver volume via the Sender set "Volume type" to "Hardware"
     CAUTION: Software or Fixed (0dB) can also be used but volume output will
     be 0dB (100%) regardless of Sender volume setting
2. In the ALSA options section
   - Select an ALSA output mode being mindful of the Help text
   - Set ALSA Loopback to "OFF"
3. In the MPD Options section EDIT MPD settings
   - Set SoX Resampling Enabled to "No"
3. In the Equalizers section set the following DSP's to "Off"
   - Crossfeed
   - Polarity inversion
   - Graphic EQ
   - Parametric EQ
   - CamillaDSP

B) Renderer Configuratiuon (Menu, Configure, Renderers)

1. Set all Audio Renderers to "Off"
2. Set DLNA server to "Off"

C) Multiroom Configuration (Menu, Configure, Multiroom)
   Optionally Multiroom CONFIGURE while still on Audio Config screen.

1. Set the Receiver daemon to ON
2. Set Master volume opt-in to YES if desired. This allows Receiver volume to be
   controlled by the volume knob in Playback or Playbar view of the Sender.

SENDER CONFIGURATION

The Sender should be a dedicated computer configured to output to the integrated
HDMI port or optionally the Headphone jack but not connected to any speakers or
headphones. It functions solely as a Music Server that sends its audio output to
one or more multiroom Receivers.

A) Audio Configuration (Menu, Configure, Audio)

1. In the Audio Output section
   - Set Output device to "HDMI 1"
   - Set Volume type to "Hardware"
   - Set ALSA Output mode to "Default (plughw)"
2. In the ALSA Options section
   - Set ALSA Loopback to "ON"
3. In the MPD Options section EDIT MPD settings
   - Set SoX Resampling Enabled to "No"
4. In the Equalizers section set the following DSP's to "Off"
   - Crossfeed
   - Polarity inversion
   - Graphic EQ
   - Parametric EQ
   - CamillaDSP

B) Renderer Configuratiuon (Menu, Configure, Renderers)

1. Set the following Audio Renderers to "Off"
   - Bluetooth
   - Squeezelite
   - RoonBridge
2. Optionally turn on AirPlay and/or Spotify connect renderers
3. Set DLNA server to "Off"

B) Sender Configuration (Menu, Configure, Multiroom)

1. DISCOVER Receivers. This is necessary to generate the list of Receiver hosts
   and their IP addresses. This must be done initially and whenever hosts are
   added or removed from the configuration.
2. Set Sender daemon to "ON"
3. Optionally set Initial volume for the Receivers. This action simply sets
   each Receiver's volume to an initial level for convenience.
4. In Playback view the Sender icon will appear at the top middle. Click this
   icon to open the Receivers panel which lists each Receiver, its On/Off state,
   volume and mute state. Receiver volume can be adjusted via the slider
   followed by clicking on the volume button. Mute state can be toggled by
   clicking on the mute button.

NETWORKING AND AUDIO FORMAT

A) Networking

The performance of the system depends on having low latency, high throughput
networking and hosts. If any hosts are connected via WiFi then interference
in the WiFi band can result in degraded performance and audio dropouts.

1. Discovery of Receivers relies on Multicast DNS (mDNS)
2. Addressing for the audio distribution protocol relies on IP Multicast using
   a default address of 239.0.0.1 and port 1350. Many residential Routers
   support Multicast by performing Multicast to Unicast (M-to-U) conversion but
   in some cases both IP Multicast and IGMP Snooping need to be explicitly
   enabled in the Router.

B) Audio format

1. Audio is converted to 16 bit 48 kHz PCM format and encoded using the Opus
   CODEC. Resampling if needed is handled by ALSA using the Speex converter.
   For playback via MPD the SoX resampler can be used instead. Set Bit depth to
   to "Any" and Sample rate to 48. This may provide higher quality resampling
   than ALSA/Speex.
2. Encoded Opus frames are transmitted over the network using RTP over UDP

SPOTIFY AND AIRPLAY

Playing Spotify or AirPlay through the Sender sets the Receiver hardware
volume to 100% (0dB). Overall volume is controlled by the Spotify or AirPlay
client. Receiver volume is restored after the client disconnects.

USAGE NOTES

1. Spotify and AirPlay support is a work-in-progress (WIP) in this initial
   release. AirPlay generally works well with few audio glitches but Spotify
   can occasionally be glitchy.
2. The 2.4 GHz WiFi band which is crowded and prone to interference should be
   avoided. Use the 5GHz band for best results.
3. ARM6 single-core Pi's including Pi-1B and Pi-Zero have not been tested as
   either Sender or Receiver and so YMMV.
4. The SQL table cfg_multiroom contains the configuration parameters for the
   feature. Parameters not exposed in the Multiroom Config screen can be edited
   in this table for development and testing purposes.
